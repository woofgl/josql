josql
=====

A SQL driven ORM that does not do black magic but knows what it talking about (i.e. knows the schema to provide default mapping). (experimental, postgres support only -for now-)

build
====
Make sure to run the ```\i src/test/resources/josql_test_db.sql``` on your postgresql (current unit tests use this database)
